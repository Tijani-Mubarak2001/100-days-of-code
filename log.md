#Day 1: So today i kicked of my 100 days off coding and I worked on a project called the time series analysis forecast. I was able to learn two models to make forecast and they are the Baseline model and the Autoregressive Integrated moving Average (ARIMA). My aim basically is to clean the data, by removing outliers and forecast the total number if female births in California. 
#Day 2: Today I worked on ways to make my ARIMA model predict Better through the Standardization and Normalization processes, and suprisingly, my model predicted with a reasonable improvement in Accuracy. I worked on my portfolio Website too.
#Day 3: I worked only on my portfoli App.
#Day 4: I deployed my portfolio App.
